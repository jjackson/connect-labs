/* The question, in one object — and the table that says what each part of it
   invalidates.

   This file exists because of how the surface used to work. Fifteen module
   globals, and every control mutated some of them and then called its own
   combination of reload() / fetchSelection() / refreshScope() /
   renderPicker(). Nothing said which combination was right, so each new
   control guessed: the year picker refreshed the table and not the download
   link, the rank checkbox refetched the whole map it could not affect, and
   changing indicator kept a pinned admin level that the new indicator had no
   data at. Every one of those was a real bug, and they were all the same bug.

   So: a control sets a field. It never decides what to redraw. The
   INVALIDATES table decides, once, for everybody. */
