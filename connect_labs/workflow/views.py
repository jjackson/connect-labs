    them so JOIN dependencies execute before their dependents.

    Returns (ordered_sources, configs_by_alias). The caller passes
    configs_by_alias to `resolve_join_hashes` and consumes ordered_sources
    in order so each pipeline runs after the pipelines its JOINs read from.

    Why topological sort matters: visits.joins[0]={"from_alias":"registrations"}
    means visits' SQL reads `labs_computed_visit_cache WHERE config_hash =
    <registrations_hash>`. If registrations hasn't run yet that cache slot is
    empty and visits' JOIN returns NULL for every joined field — silent
    correctness gap, not an error. Running registrations FIRST populates the
    slot before visits queries it.

    `opp_ids`/`request`/`access_token` are optional — pass them (a multi-opp
    workflow's spanned opportunities) so a pipeline owned by a different opp
    than `pipeline_access`'s own scope still resolves; see
    `_resolve_pipeline_definition`. Omit them to keep the old single-scope
    lookup (harmless for pipelines that already match `pipeline_access`'s
    scope, which covers every existing caller before this parameter existed).

    Edge cases:
    - A pipeline whose schema can't be loaded is excluded from the topo sort
      and appended at the end so the rest of the workflow still progresses.
      The streaming loop will surface the per-pipeline error from its own
      definition lookup.
    - Cycles (rare, would mean two pipelines JOIN each other) fall through to
      definition order rather than infinite-looping. Worth detecting later.

@require_GET
def workflow_auth_status_api(request):
    """
    Workflow framework auth-status endpoint.

    Returns the live state of every OAuth provider the workflow runner can
    require: Connect, CommCare HQ, OCS. Each entry has `active` (true if the
    session has a non-expired access token), `authorize_url` (where to send
    the user to refresh that service), and `label` (display name).

    The runner reads `definition.config.auth_requires` (a list of provider
    keys) and gates entry to the workflow's render_code on every required
    provider being `active`. Templates that don't list this field default to
    `["connect"]` (already enforced by labs login_required middleware).

    Behavior beyond a timestamp check:
      * For each provider, if the access token has expired, attempt a silent
        refresh using the stored refresh_token. The framework gate then only
        forces re-authorization when refresh actually fails.
      * For `commcare_hq`, when ?opportunity_id= is supplied, we additionally
        ping the CCHQ Application API for the opportunity's domain. This
        catches the case where refresh "succeeded" but came back with a
        downgraded scope, or the user lost domain membership — situations
        where the timestamp would say active but pipelines still 403.

    Query params:
        next (optional): URL to redirect back to after re-authorization.
            Defaults to the request's referer or the workflow runner page.
        opportunity_id (optional): If supplied, enable the real CCHQ ping for
            that opportunity's domain. Without this we can only do timestamp +
            refresh checks for CCHQ.
        requires (optional): Comma-separated provider keys the runner actually
            gates on (from `definition.config.auth_requires`). When present and
            it does NOT include `commcare_hq`, we skip the CommCare/Connect
            metadata round-trip entirely — a connect-only workflow shouldn't
            pay (or hang on) a probe whose only purpose is the CCHQ
            domain-access check. Absent => probe as before (back-compat with
            older runner bundles that don't send this param).
