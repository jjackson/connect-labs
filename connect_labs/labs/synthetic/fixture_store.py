"""Loads per-opp fixture JSON from Google Drive, cached per-process AND shared.

Two tiers, because one was not enough
-------------------------------------
L1 is a plain dict, keyed by (opp_id, folder_id, endpoint_key). L2 is the Django
cache (Redis in every deployed environment).

L1 alone was the original design, and on 2026-08-26 it was measured doing almost
nothing. `WorkflowRunView` loads workers for every opportunity a multi-opp
workflow spans; for synthetic opps each of those is a Drive folder-listing plus
a file download. A run page over 11 opps is therefore 22 sequential Drive
round-trips, and prod serves on 6 independent processes (WEB_CONCURRENCY=3 x 2
tasks), each holding its own L1. A warm entry was reachable roughly one load in
six, so real page loads paid the full fan-out over and over: 12-16s each, for
bytes that had already been fetched minutes earlier by a sibling process.

L2 makes one process's fetch serve all six. Redis is configured with
IGNORE_EXCEPTIONS, so if it is unavailable every read simply misses and the
behaviour degrades to exactly the L1-only design -- never an error.

# Compression is what makes storing them reasonable rather than just raising the
