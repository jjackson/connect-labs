"""Resolution, aggregation, and threshold selection.

Three jobs, in dependency order:

  ``resolve()``       one indicator, one boundary → a value plus where it came
                      from, walking up the hierarchy for measures that inherit.
  ``aggregate()``     many values → one, by the rule the measure registry
                      declares. Counts sum; rates take their declared weighted
                      mean. This is the only place aggregation happens.
  ``select_above()``  the threshold query, rolled up to the coarsest unit that
                      is honestly describable.

Nothing here writes. Inheritance in particular is resolved on read and never
materialised, so re-running an ingest cannot leave stale copies fanned out
across child boundaries.

        This replaced ``off_method_units``, and the rename is the point. That
        field counted units answered by a source the method did not declare —
        an internal notion, and one that is now structurally impossible, since
        an ineligible source is no longer used at all (see ``policy.py``).

        What a reader actually needs to know survived the fix: a rate legitimately
        inherits downward, so a selection can be a mixture of regions measured in
        their own right and regions carrying their country's figure. Both are
        defensible and each row says which it is, but the mixture changes what a
        total *means* — and the difference between being able to ask "how much of
        this is really local?" and having to take it on faith is one number.

        A rolled-up country row contributes the number of its regions that
        borrowed, not all-or-nothing — a country that measured three of its five
        regions is two-fifths inherited, and saying so is more use than either
        rounding.
