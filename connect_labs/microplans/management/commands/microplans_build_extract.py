"""Cut a same-region Overture country extract onto the CURRENT pinned release.

Why this exists: the extract was originally cut by hand. When Overture pruned
the release we were pinned to (2026-05-20.0) and the pin moved to 2026-08-19.0,
Nigeria's extract was left behind on the dead release — `covering_region()`
correctly ignores a mismatched release, so every uncached Nigerian ward silently
fell back to the cross-region live read at ~350s instead of ~5s. Nothing failed;
it just got slow, and stayed slow, because re-cutting it was undocumented work
nobody could repeat.

Reads the public Overture bucket once, writes one Parquet per 1-degree tile
(hive-partitioned tx/ty) to our own us-east-1 bucket, in exactly the column
shape `_query_extract` reads back.

    manage.py microplans_build_extract nigeria
    manage.py microplans_build_extract nigeria --dry-run

After it finishes, point EXTRACT_REGIONS at the new release — the command
prints the one-line edit — and the router picks it up on the next fetch.
