"""The partner network over time, and where it is.

Two questions on one payload, because they are the same story told twice: how
many organisations joined the network by a given month, and how many of them had
delivered anything by then. The gap between those lines is the bench — partners
recruited and not yet activated — and it is most of the network.

Joining is a directory fact: it is the date they answered an EOI, which Connect
never sees. Delivering is a Connect fact, computed here from the spine rather
than stored, so it cannot go stale.

Dating a partner's first delivery needs two guards, both learned the hard way:

**completed_works cannot date anything before 2025-01-14.** Connect bulk-created
81k rows at one instant that day, so every partner already active then shares a
single false timestamp. Reading it naively collapses the entire founding cohort
onto one date.

**Device clocks lie.** A visit's ``field_ts`` comes off a handset and can be
years out — one partner's earliest claims 2010. The server-assigned ``sync_ts``
is what is trusted, with a sanity floor under it.
