"""Locating partners, and drawing the network's growth.

Two things are easy to get wrong here and both are silent. A location resolver
that guesses produces a map nobody can challenge -- a dot is a dot, whether it
came from a street address or the word "Nigeria" -- so precision is asserted as
hard as position. And the growth series is dated from a spine with two known
traps in it, tested here so a later refactor cannot quietly reintroduce them.
