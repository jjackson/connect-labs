"""Best-effort coordinates for a partner's head office.

The directory records where a partner is three different ways, none of them
coordinates: a country from a dropdown (clean), regions of operation (free text,
two thirds empty), and an office address (free text, and frequently not an
address at all -- "Nothing", an email, a PO box with no town).

So this resolves to the finest thing each row can actually support and *says
which*, because the alternative is a map that draws a rooftop pin from the word
"Nigeria". Precision travels with the point and the map renders it differently:

  city     a town in the address matched the gazetteer         exact enough to pin
  region   a region of operation matched an ADM1 boundary      a district, not a desk
  country  only the country is known                           a country, drawn as one

Sources are both already in this repository. Towns come from ``static/pulse/
towns.js`` -- GeoNames cities500, filtered to the countries Connect delivers in,
which pulse already ships for its "nearest town" labels. Regions and countries
come from ``labs.admin_boundaries``, the same PostGIS polygons ``geo.py`` uses.
Nothing here calls an external geocoder: partner addresses are not ours to send
to a third party, and a network dependency inside an import is a bad trade for
data that changes a few times a year.
