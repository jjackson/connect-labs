"""Load delivery-partner identity from the LLO Directory into the database.

    make manage CMD="pulse_partner_import --dry-run"
    make manage CMD="pulse_partner_import"

The directory is the source of truth for who a partner is. This pulls it in so
that no partner name lives in the repository, where the people who own that
identity cannot review it and where it drifts silently from the sheet.

Reads two tabs:

  Organizations         column A the name, column B the short name, and the
                        three location columns — G countries, H regions of
                        operation, K office address — which ``hq_location``
                        resolves to a point and a precision.
  AI Enrichment …       column A the name, column B the date the partner joined
                        the network, column C the basis for it.
  Connect Org Mapping   column A a Connect org slug, column I the partner to
                        attribute it to, for the slugs no string rule reaches.
                        Column F carries the reason, which is required — an
                        alias without one is a guess someone will later trust.

Authenticates with the service account already on both task definitions
(``LABS_SYNTHETIC_GDRIVE_SA_KEY``), the same one targeting uses. Nothing new to
provision.

Not destructive by default: partners absent from the sheet are left alone
unless ``--prune`` says the sheet is authoritative, which mirrors
``targeting_import`` and exists for the same reason — a half-loaded sheet
should not silently delete a partner mid-run.
